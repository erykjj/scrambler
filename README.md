# Scrambler


## Purpose

This is a silly little script that randomly scrambles the interior letters of words with four or more letters, leaving the initial and final letters intact. Why? To prove how capable the human brain is to "decipher" the *meaning* even though the words are spelled incorrectly. *May* work in other languages. Use at own risk :-)

____
## Usage

```
$ python Scrambler.py INFILE.TXT OUTFILE.TXT
```

____
## Example

The introductory paragraph may come out something like this:

```
